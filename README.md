In Loopback (2.x/3.x), models were responsible for both accessing data in other systems (databases, SOAP services, etc.) and providing the application's external REST API. This made it easy to quickly build a REST interface for an existing database, but difficult to customize the REST API and fine-tune it to the needs of application clients.

LoopBack v4 is moving to the well-known Model-(View-)Controller pattern, where the code responsible for data access and manipulation is separated from the code responsible for implementing the REST API.

In loopback-next-example we demonstrate this loose coupling. The facade here uses a set of repositories one corresponding to each of the Account, Customer & Transaction microservice. These repositories are nothing but swagger connectors to the corresponding services running locally on the given ports, defined in swagger configurations of the services. These ports are 3001, 3002 & 3003 for Account, Customer and Transaction services respectively. The services along with the facade, reside in services folder. Each of the services has its own set of repositories, which can be connections to one or many other dependent services. In a typical scenario, there will at least be one repository which represents the DB access for that model. In our loopback-next-example all the services Accout, Customer and Transaction have one repository that represents the DB access and uses the in memory database connector, to connect to the in memory db.
